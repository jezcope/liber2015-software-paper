## Notes for contributors ##

The document itself is written in markdown, a simple text format. If you're not familiar with it, give it a try! If you're still not comfortable, let me know and I'll give you a copy in Word format to contribute to and merge the changes back in myself.

I tend to follow the following conventions when writing:

- Mark things to do inline using ***TODO: whatever*** - this makes it easier to search the document and find outstanding things still to do
- 

Thanks,
