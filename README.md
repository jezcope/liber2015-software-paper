## Notes for contributors ##

The document itself is written in [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), a simple text format that you can edit with any text editor (e.g. Notepad). If you're not familiar with it, give it a try! If you're still not comfortable, let me know and I'll give you a copy in Word format to contribute to and merge the changes back in myself.

I tend to follow the following conventions when writing; other contributors don't have to but it will make things easier!

- Mark things to do inline using ***TODO: whatever*** — this makes it easier to search the document and find outstanding things still to do
- Break lines often and at natural points in sentences — markdown ignores these linebreaks mid-paragraph, but they make later editing and merging of changes much easier

Thanks,
