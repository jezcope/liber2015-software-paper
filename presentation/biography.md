Jez Cope is currently Research Data Support Manager in the library of Imperial College London. He is responsible for developing a research data management service within the library to train and advise researchers of all levels and to develop an infrastructure for data curation, preservation and sharing. This includes engaging directly with researchers, developing the skills and knowledge of library staff in this area and working across all support services at the College.

He previously worked at the University of Bath, where he played a major part in setting up research data management infrastructure through the Jisc-funded Research360 project, as well as developing a virtual research environment for the Centre for Sustainable Chemical Technologies and spearheading social media training for postgraduate students and early career researchers.

He also has several years of experience in computational systems biology research, following on from a degree in mathematics and computer science, and occasionally contributes to open-source software projects (including the Open Access Button: https://www.openaccessbutton.org/);. This gives him a particular appreciation of the importance of software to the research process and the importance of recognising it as a first-class research output.
